# Krown Apparel

Clothing brand e-commerce project made by [react](https://reactjs.org/).\
This is part of [Complete React Developer in 2021 (w/Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) and I modified some parts (components, files, etc.,) and added some functionality.

## V.01

This project using `styled-components` and `sass` for styling. Connecting with [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).\

It used `React Context` for state management.

## V.02

- Migrate state management from `React Context` to `Redux Toolkit`
- Using `createAsyncThunk` for fetching categories data
- Added spinner (when app still fetching categories data)
